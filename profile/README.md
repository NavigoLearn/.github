# NavigoLearn
## You can't know what you don't know.
NavigoLearn is a community-driven and open-source project that aims to help people learn programming. Access to community-made roadmaps saves you from the hassle of figuring out what to do when learning a new topic.

## What is a roadmap?

A roadmap is a way to structure information in a way that it takes you from knowing nothing about a topic to knowing everything about it.

For example, if you were to learn web development you can follow a roadmap that takes you from learning HTML to learning popular frameworks like React or Vue.

## How do I use NavigoLearn?

NavigoLearn is still in development, the website isn't available yet. Stay tuned for updates.

## How do I contribute to NavigoLearn?

We welcome contributions from anyone who wants to improve NavigoLearn. You can contribute by:

- Creating or updating roadmaps
- Supplying feedback or ideas
- Reporting or fixing bugs
- Suggesting or implementing new features
- Writing or translating documentation

Suppose you plan on creating a pull request, please read our contributing guidelines. (To be added)

## Who are we?

We are a group of five University students in Cluj-Napoca, Romania passionate about technology and learning. We created NavigoLearn as a way to help people share their knowledge and experience, as well as help new learners find their way in programming.

We hope to create a supportive and inclusive community where everyone can nerd about what they love. If you want to know more about us, the time will come... a bit later.
