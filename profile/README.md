## You can't know what you don't know. 🤷‍♂️
NavigoLearn is a community-driven and open-source project that aims to help people learn programming. Access to community-made roadmaps saves you from the hassle of figuring out what to do when learning a new topic.🙌

## What is a roadmap? 🗺️

A roadmap is a way to structure information in a way that it takes you from knowing nothing about a topic to knowing everything about it.

For example, if you were to learn web development you can follow a roadmap that takes you from learning HTML to learning popular frameworks like React or Vue.

## How do I use NavigoLearn? 🔨🤔
